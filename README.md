# SystemSetup

This is a log on how I have configured my development machine for primarily Java, android and web development. The setup was done on a late 2015 MacBook Pro 13-inch with 128 GB of memory and as such, is designed to be pretty lean on storage space.

## 1. Basic Configuration
Breathe in the new mac smell, touch the aluminium, try out the keyboard etc. Once the acquaintance is done, create a user profile and add a picture of you in the machine. 

## 2. Directory Configuration
